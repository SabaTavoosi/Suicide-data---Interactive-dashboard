# Suicide data: Interactive dashboard

Interactive dashbaord created with RMarkdown. 

The dashboard can be viewed on kaggle at [https://www.kaggle.com/tavoosi/suicide-data-full-interactive-dashboard](https://www.kaggle.com/tavoosi/suicide-data-full-interactive-dashboard). However, I recommend running and opening it up in R for a better version; all you need to do is to download and run the `suicide data dashboard.rmd` file.
